## Project Challenges

To start, this was a very intensive project. If you were not careful, a simple mistake in the beginning could have large ramifications further along in the implementation process. An example would be how I initially set up my data structures. I did not realize how critical setting up the `StringBuilders` as array types were, so I only made `rowStr` and `colStr` normal `StringBuilder` types and went about deleting and appending for every cell. This was not an effective method of implementation because it required an incredible amount of special cases to account for and altogether was just a headache to try to do.

A valuable lesson that I learned in this project is that when you’re using recursion, your recursive methods should be as SMALL as possible because the larger they are, the more complicated the backtracking and overall execution of the method becomes. So, in the beginning of this project, my `solve` (recursive) method was around 300 to 350 lines long, which, looking back, is somewhat absurd. My current `solve` method is around 100 lines of actual code blocks, and the rest of the recursive method is just copy/paste with slight tweaks depending on which conditional passed.

Unfortunately, after relentlessly working to get a perfect solution on this assignment, I do have a few outliers that buck the trend of the expected results from the test files. Any unusual run times that were recorded in the table are starred with an asterisk* and can be noted when analyzing my recursive backtracking algorithm implementation.

## Asymptotic Analysis

To properly perform the asymptotic analysis for such a large project as this one, it's important that we are not getting an exact run-time analysis using ∑_all statements〖Cost*frequency〗 as we have learned how to do. Instead, we are focusing on the orders of growth that are present in the algorithm execution. This means that things such as lower order terms or multiplicative constants are not going to be considered when calculating run-time analysis. For example, in `checkPuzzle`, there are multiple `for` loops that iterate from 0 to `ourBoard.length` or iterating through all of the `StringBuilders`, but those can be disregarded in the asymptotic analysis because the worst case is going to be a constant that is reasonable and not approaching infinity.

The part of this algorithm that needs to be carefully looked over is `fillPuzzle`, since even when you find a valid solution to a square on the board, it can be undone and have to be regenerated if the prefix did not meet the `fillPuzzle` requirements. This means that the run-time of this program is based entirely on how big the board is, and the size of the board determines which order of growth the algorithm is going to run at. For instance, if the board is size 3, then you have n attempts at finding the right square * 3 which is n * n * n. Now, because this is asymptotic analysis, we are looking for the normal case, and having to take n attempts for each tile is highly unlikely, so you divide n * n * n by 2n to give you n^2/2, and since we only care about orders of magnitude, we can simplify that to just n^2, which is quadratic.

You can observe in the table how this analysis correlates with incredibly fast run times for a 3x3 board but they exponentially increase as the table size increases. Another example would be a 5x5 board which takes approximately 35 seconds compared to just 0.18 seconds for a 3x3 board!

So what would be the worst case scenario for `fillPuzzle()`? Well, regarding that there are approximately 171,000 words in the dictionary, and on average there are 5 characters in a given word. You could estimate that there are 500,000 to 700,000 characters in the dictionary class. Which means that if you were to pass in an incredibly large board to try to find some of the 30-character long words that are available, this implementation could potentially take days to complete and return if a solution was found. What’s really fascinating is that as soon as a solution is generated, the next step of the algorithm which is approximately the same amount of lines of code, will execute and complete within a matter of seconds compared to the hours that it just spent trying to find a solution.
